# Installation

The recommended way to get started using the `Async Mongodb` is by using the `npm` (Node Package Manager) to install the dependency in your project.

Given that you have created your own project using `npm init` we install `Async Mongodb` and its dependencies by executing the following `npm` command.

```bash
npm install asyncmongodb --save
```

This will download the `asyncmongodb` and add a dependency entry in your `package.json` file.

## Quick Start

This guide will show you how to set up a simple application using `asyncmongodb`. 

### Create the `package.json` file

First, create a directory where your application will live.

```bash
mkdir myproject
cd myproject
```

Enter the following command and answer the questions to create the initial structure for your new project:

```bash
npm init
```

Next, install `asyncmongodb` dependency.

```bash
npm install asyncmongodb --save
```

You should see **NPM** download a lot of files. Once it's done you'll find all the downloaded packages under the **node_modules** directory.
